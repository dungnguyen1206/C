# Workshop 1 â€“ Exercise Q1

## Description

Write a C program that:

1. Prompts the user to input an integer `n > 5`. Re-prompts if the input is invalid.
2. Computes and displays:
   - The sum of integers from 1 to `n` (s1)
   - The factorial of `n` (s2)
   - The harmonic sum up to `n`: `1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/n` (s3)
3. Asks the user to input another number and checks if it is a prime number.

This exercise helps reinforce control structures, loops, and mathematical operations in C.
