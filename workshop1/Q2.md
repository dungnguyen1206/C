# Common Prime Divisors, GCD, and LCM

## Description

This C program takes two positive integers as input and performs the following operations:

1. Finds and displays the **common prime divisors** of the two numbers.
2. Computes the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. Calculates the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** based on the input values.
