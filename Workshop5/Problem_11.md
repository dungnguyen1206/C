## Exercise: Count Product Occurrences

Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

- Reads a line of text representing a list of product names.
- Reads another string representing the name of a product to search.
- Counts how many times the searched product name appears in the list, regardless of case.
- Outputs a message indicating the number of times the product is found, or a message saying it is not found.

**Note:** The program should treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.
