C Exercise: Write a program that reads a list of strings and a target substring, then prints all strings that contain the target substring.

- Read an integer `n`, then `n` strings.
- Read a target substring.
- Use `strstr()` to check if each string contains the substring.
- Print all matching strings on a single line.

Note: The program uses `gets()`, which is unsafe and should only be used in simple scenarios.
