## Problem Statement

Write a C program that checks if a given number is prime. If it is, convert it to its equivalent in base 8 (octal) and display the result. Otherwise, print that the number is not a prime.

### Requirements:
- Input: A single integer `n`.
- Output:
  - If `n` is a prime number, display its octal representation.
  - If not, print "`n is not a prime number`".

### Instructions:
- Use a helper function to check if `n` is a prime.
- If true, convert `n` from decimal to octal using division and remainder method.
- Print the resulting digits.
