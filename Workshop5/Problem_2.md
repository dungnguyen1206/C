# Problem 2 - Digit Frequency Counter

## Description
Write a C program that counts how many times each digit (0–9) appears in a given string.

## Input Requirements
- The user inputs a single string (no spaces), containing alphanumeric characters.

## Output Requirements
- The program prints the frequency of each digit (0–9) that appears in the string.
- Format: each line shows one digit and its count, e.g., `3 : 2`.

## Notes
- Use an array to keep count of digit frequencies.
- Only digits (`0`–`9`) are counted; other characters are ignored.
- Use `isdigit()` to check if a character is a digit.
