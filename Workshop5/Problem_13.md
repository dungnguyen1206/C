## Exercise: Product of Even Numbers

Write a C program that:

- Reads an integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 10).
- Reads an array of `n` integers.
- Calculates the product of all even numbers in the array.
- Prints the result if there are even numbers; otherwise, prints a message indicating no even number exists.

**Note:** Input validation is required to ensure `n` is between 0 and 10.
