C Exercise: Write a program that reads an array of integers, separates even and odd numbers, and sorts them differently.

- Read an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers.
- Separate even numbers into one array, and odd numbers into another.
- Sort the even numbers in ascending order.
- Sort the odd numbers in descending order.
- Print the sorted even numbers on one line and the sorted odd numbers on the next line.

Note: Sorting is done using basic nested loops (bubble sort logic).
