C Exercise: Write a program that reads an array of integers, removes duplicate values, and prints the unique elements in descending order.

- Read an integer `n` followed by `n` integers into an array.
- Remove duplicates by checking if the element has appeared before.
- Store unique elements in a new array.
- Sort the new array in descending order.
- Print the sorted unique elements.

Note: The program uses basic arrays and nested loops for both duplication check and sorting.
