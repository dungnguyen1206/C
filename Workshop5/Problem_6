C Exercise: Write a program that reads a string and prints the same string with the first letter of each word capitalized.

- Use gets() to read the input string from the user.
- Use strtok() to split the string by spaces.
- Traverse each word and convert the first character to uppercase using toupper().
- Print the result to the screen.

Note: gets() is unsafe and should only be used in simple examples.
