## Problem Statement

Write a C program that converts a binary string into its corresponding decimal number.

### Requirements:
- The program should read an input string consisting only of characters `'0'` and `'1'` with a maximum length of 15 characters.
- It then outputs the decimal equivalent of the binary number represented by the input string.

### Hint:
- Use `strlen()` to determine the length of the string.
- Loop through each character from left to right, applying the binary to decimal conversion formula:
