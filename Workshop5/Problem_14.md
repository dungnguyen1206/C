## Exercise: Two's Complement Bit Manipulation

Write a C program that:

- Reads a binary string (up to 8 bits).
- Modifies the string to represent its two's complement (used for representing negative binary numbers).
- Prints the resulting binary string.

**Note:** The function simulates computing the two's complement by finding the least significant 1 and inverting all bits to its left.
