C Exercise: Write a program that reads an integer `n` and prints the next 4 prime numbers after `n`.

- Use a function `nt(n)` to check if a number is prime.
- Read input `n` from the user.
- Continuously increment `n` and check for prime numbers.
- Stop after printing 4 prime numbers greater than `n`.

Note: The program uses `sqrt()` and checks divisibility from 2 up to âˆšn to determine primality.
